4 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
This game is a fun, simple racing simulator with both solo and multiplayer options. Players are able to customize their vehicles with paint and stickers, and can even build their own custom tracks to share with others online. There's also a built-in video editing feature which allows players to take recordings of their races and make short productions.

Learning the controls for the racing portion of the game is very straight-forward, and players who prefer different keybindings are able to quickly adjust them in the options menu. The vehicles are quick and responsive, and there are three different camera angles players are able to toggle between throughout the races. Each pre-built track comes with a variety of obstacles to navigate, and gradually ramps up the difficulty in times for the player to beat. This gives the player plenty of chances to hone their skill and find their best driving techniques.

The track editor is easy to use once the player becomes accustomed with the different available pieces, but if there's an in-game guide, I was unable to locate it. Figuring out which piece served which function was a process of trial and error. However, the good news is that it's quick and easy to take a test run on the track in progress and then return to the editing mode.

Since this is an older game, players on newer operating systems may experience difficulty in launching it. When I first opened it after installing, I wasn't able to get past a white screen with a few colored boxes. Luckily, [Steam User Komisario Palmu has written up a workaround for this issue](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448953593) and it allowed me to successfully launch and play the game. It appears it doesn't work for all users, going by the reviews of the guide, but the game is certainly worth trying. I'm not deducting any points from the game in the score for this, since in all fairness, this game is from 2008, and I can't fairly judge whether this was an issue on prior operating systems.

## Final Thoughts
I enjoy light and fast racing games, and TrackMania Nations Forever is a great, free option for people who want something that's easy to pick up and fun to play. The multiple difficulty levels for each track are good incentive to go back and set new records even after completing a race. There are many online servers to play on with other people, and the game plays just as smoothly and reliably in multiplayer as it does on solo.

I do think the track editor could use some sort of tutorial to better help the player understand what they're doing so they don't need to stumble through it. Even simple boxes to click through the first time the editor is pulled up would be helpful.
