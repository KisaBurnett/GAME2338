**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, but the fun lessened when experiencing the issue listed below.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The game frequently failed to read jump command inputs, which often resulted in death and restart. It happened the most frequently with the space bar, so I began using the w key to jump instead. It seemed to fail less often, but still often enough to hinder gameplay. This issue was noted mostly when attempting to jump while running. I attempted coming to a complete stop before jumping, but doing so means losing momentum, and there are some jumps that require it to cross. The issue reoccurred the most when near a wall, even when not directly touching it.
