**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Yes. The controls were simple, and the puzzles were straightforward.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The maze puzzles and the house exploration sequences felt very disjointed. The game would have benefitted from focusing on one or the either for its duration.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The puzzles are very simple and self-explanatory, which makes the game unbalanced in the player's favor. The target audience appears to be younger fans of survival horror who are looking for a more casual experience.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ No. The game alternates between being too fast-paced and too slow. The walk speed of the player character is also excruciatingly slow, so I ended up sprinting for the entire game. The sprint felt more appropriate for a normal walking pace, and should have been made the standard speed.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ No. It was difficult to make sense of what story the game tried to tell, because the sequences felt very disjointed from one another in both mechanics and storyline.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, but I was occasionally frustrated when trying to interact with objects or navigate dark areas that looked the same.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The interface is very finicky when interacting with objects. Even on large buttons, I had to get very close and place the reticle on very small, specific sections on the object to be able to interact with it.
