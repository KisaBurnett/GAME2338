### Rating
2 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
The object of this game is to hide mermaid eggs from hungry sharks. There are 12 eggs to hide and 12 levels to play. The player must keep at least one egg through the final level to win. Players acquire in-game currency as they progress through the levels, allowing them to purchase items to better hide the eggs.

There is a set of instructions written by the developer which can be accessed before playing the game. They appear clear at first, but turned out to be slightly misleading upon starting the game. There were no apparent places to hide the eggs, as the entire level is a large picture of a coral reef. The instructions say sharks will go for their favorite items, but it's impossible to see most of the items because of the background picture.

The currency gained at the end of each level is the amount of eggs remaining multiplied by ten. If players find most of their eggs gobbled up in the first level, they'll find the prices of the purchasable items extremely unforgiving. The more affordable items such as the net turned out to be next to useless, so it's best to try and save up funds for the more expensive ones, assuming the player can survive long enough to do so.

## Final Thoughts
I think the concept of this game is cute, and I enjoy games which involve puzzles and strategy. But the use of a blown up picture as the background of the level makes it hard to see. The proper way to strategize isn't clear, and the game quickly becomes confusing.
