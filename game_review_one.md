## Summary
Nocturne: Rebirth is a role-playing game about Reviel, a vampire who finds himself taken in by a young woman named Luna after saving her from a group of bandits in the forest. He learns through the kind and cheerful Luna that her village, Algiz, has been afflicted by a deadly epidemic, and evidence of vampire attacks has drawn the attention of a renowned vampire hunter. This could mean unwanted attention for Reviel, but as a dark mystery of deadly magic slowly unfolds, he takes an interest in finding the one behind it. Luna insists on helping, and the two become unlikely partners.

Battles are fought using a turn-based party system which requires strategic use of skills and items to defeat enemies. Combat is initiated by coming into direct contact with wandering enemies, which means the player can avoid small encounters if desired. Reviel has the ability to utilize monstrous familiars, which serve as party members after being summoned. Each of these familiars have different skills and strengths, which allows the player to customize their tactics.

The majority of combat takes place in dungeon levels, which are filled with enemies and treasure boxes. Complete party death in the dungeons does not result in a “Game Over”, but rather returns the player back to the beginning of the level with gained currency and experience. This makes it easy to return to town, purchase more items if needed, and start the process over again in the interest of leveling up quickly.

## Final Thoughts
Nocturne: Rebirth was developed using RPG Maker XP, according to [its itch.io page](https://eplipswich.itch.io/nocturne-rebirth), which contributes to a smooth, familiar combat system. The battles are quick and intuitive, and the menus are simple and easy to navigate. However, since the name of the active party member is not displayed during combat, it can be difficult to tell whose turn it is until entering the skills menu to see what can be used. Downloading and launching the game is simple, and it performed smoothly on my machine without any issues the entire time I played.

The art and music are beautiful and serve to immerse the player in the game’s world. I found the lore and characters intriguing, and the more I played, the more I wanted to know about what was going on. The tutorial phase of the game was helpful, if rather long and overly restrictive. Overall, I was very impressed by the quality of the game and look forward to playing more of it.
