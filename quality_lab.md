## Dark Souls
This challenging game carved itself a place in infamy as more and more players entered the fray, prepared to die repeatedly. I believe it did so at least in part by meeting multiple quality factors. These include:
- Reliability
  - Rarely, if ever crashes.
  - Performs consistently and can be played for long periods of time without functional issues.
- Efficiency
  - Utilizes resources well and doesn't overtax the machine, whether playing on PC or console.
- Usability
  - Operated with simple basic controls which are easy for the player to learn.
  - Efficiently teaches the player how to play through both interaction and written instructions.
- Flexibility
  - Offers a variety of options both in game configuration and character builds to meet differing player preferences.
  - Has been modified successfully on PC by a multitude of players who find new ways to enrich the experience.
- Correctness
  - Uses correct spelling and grammar in menus and dialog.
- Portability
  - Has been effectively ported to multiple platforms as recently as October 2018, when it was brought to the Nintendo Switch.

  - Rarely experiences network errors while playing online with other players.
