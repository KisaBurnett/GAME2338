### Rating
5 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
The Perpetual Testing Initiative was included in an update for the PC version of Portal 2. It allows players to design and build their own test chambers, and share them with the community. The level editor is available directly within Portal 2's main menu, and is free for people who own the game.

The editor uses a sleek and simple interface and display, which helps keep the program running smoothly even as the player adds more and more features to their test chamber. It provides gentle guidance with graphics rather than walls of text, done in the style of the advisories found in the Portal games. The test-builder is able to switch to the game view of the chamber in progress quickly and easily in order to make sure it plays the way they expect.

Customizing the test chambers is as easy as clicking and dragging. Builders can pull the wall panels around to change the size and layout of the chamber, and a pop-out side menu offers all of the additional features such as buttons and cube dispensers. Elements can be combined or altered by right clicking and selecting from the menu.

## Final Thoughts
Portal 2's Perpetual Testing Initiative is honestly the easiest, most enjoyable level editor I've ever used. It's easy to understand and use, and performs reliably, which puts the focus where it should be: Designing a fun and challenging puzzle. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in level design.
