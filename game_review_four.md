This online game is a web browser version of the popular dice game Yahtzee. Players have thirteen turns to roll dice and tally up as many points as possible for pre-defined combinations. Each combination can only be claimed for points once, and the players must select the combination they wish to apply at the end of each turn. This particular version matches the player with one opponent. The player has the option of playing against a computer or playing against another person online.
