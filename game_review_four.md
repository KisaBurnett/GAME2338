4 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
This online game is a web browser version of the popular dice game Yahtzee. Players have 13 turns to roll dice and tally up as many points as possible for pre-defined combinations. Each combination can only be claimed for points once, and the players must select the combination they wish to apply at the end of each turn. This particular version matches the player with one opponent. The player has the option of playing against a computer or playing against another person online.

This game makes learning easy for new players by providing a written tutorial and a link to a video showing an example game being played. It also assists the player in strategizing which rolled combination will give them the best points by displaying tallied points on the score card. For example, if a player has 2 ones and 3 fours, the scorecard will show that they can take 2 points for the ones, 12 points for the fours, 25 points for the full house, 19 points for three of a kind, or 19 points for chance. The player simply clicks the option they wish to keep, and the score is added. This makes the gameplay quick and easy.

The game uses a minimalistic interface, which makes it easy for browsers to run and easy for players to wind up playing for hours. It's intuitive and efficient, if not the most attractive. Both beginner and veteran Yahtzee players can enjoy this simple version of the game.

## Final Thoughts
I like the scorecard feature and the fact the game plays to strengths of simplicity. It's easy to pull up the game in a tab and spend a few minutes unwinding without having to worry about overtaxing the browser. I'm not as fond of the color scheme, and find it a little straining on the eyes. I also think it would be more visually pleasing to use icons which are a little more modern. But overall, I enjoy this game, and have already spent far too much time playing it.
