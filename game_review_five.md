## Summary
This game is a fully fleshed out version of the mini game in The Witcher 3. The object is to win two out of three hands by having the highest number of points at the end of each hand. Different cards have various abilities which may add or remove points for one or both players. Players are also able to choose special leader abilities which may be used in conjunction with card placement during their turns.

There are several different starter deck sets to complement various play styles. Their designs are based on factions which appear within The Witcher's universe, and their specialized cards' abilities have been catered to replicate the strengths and weaknesses found within them. Examples include the nightmarish Monsters starter deck, which favors destructive power that affects both players' units, and the Scoia'Tael, which is comprised of mystical races like the Elves and Dwarves that enrich one another with magical attributes.

Players are also able to fully customize their decks between games, and there are multiple ways to acquire new cards with new abilities. There is an in-game store which allows players to purchase cards with real world funds, or acquired in-game currency. The in-game currency can be gained fairly quickly and easily by winning matches and progressing the story, which means it isn't necessary to pay in order to have a superior hand. Expansion pack cards are also obtainable through the in-game currency system.

The initial tutorial portion of the game sets the player against AI opponents, but once this tutorial period is over, players are matched with online competitors with a similar level. The player is able to turn on a timer option in the game, which will cut players off in their turns if they take too long to make their moves. This keeps the game moving swiftly, and adds a sense of urgency to the turns.

## Final Thoughts
I like how easy it is for new players to pick up this game, and how it encourages trying new strategies to improve one's skill. The tutorial phase for the card game itself is very thorough and streamlined, and gives the player time to absorb the concepts. All of the cards are beautifully illustrated and have simple animations that give the player more to look at without bogging down the computer. The only bump in the road I encountered was some difficulty deciphering icons in the deck building menu of the game. There are no tips or legend to explain them, so it took some guessing and trial and error before I started really understanding what I was looking at.
