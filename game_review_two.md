## Summary
The 2016 entry in the gruesomely fun DOOM series marks a return to fast-paced shooter action after the slower, more suspenseful experience in DOOM 3. It follows the Doom Marine, who awakens after being retrieved inside an artifact from Hell. He finds himself in a research facility on Mars, which has been completely overrun by demons. Players learn alongside the Doom Marine that the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) was on the red planet to study and harvest Argent Energy. This wouldn't explain where demons came into the picture... except it's soon revealed that Ardent Energy is secretly mined from Hell itself.

The DOOM series has long been known for its graphic violence and gore, and this game proudly lives up to its standard. Players are gifted a plethora of guns which will (and do) blow the demons to bloody smithereens, and are also given a chainsaw for good measure. Seriously wounding an enemy grants an opening for a "glory kill," which allows the player to quickly close the distance and perform a brutal finishing blow that is guaranteed to drop health boosts. This mechanic encourages players to abandon cautious tactics and throw themselves into the fray. Doing so reveals a thrilling game that will get almost anyone's heart rate spiking.

The game also offers numerous challenges to enhance the player's experience. Secrets are scattered throughout levels and offer anything from power-ups to little collectibles for showing off. Chapters of the game reward carrying out optional tasks to test the player's skill in combat, such as racking up different glory kills or killing multiple enemies with one trigger-pull of a weapon. These little bonuses make it even easier to justify replaying areas again and again.

DOOM is intended to be a reimagining of the first game to reboot the series, according to [Executive Producer Marty Strutton](https://www.vg247.com/2014/07/18/doom-4-details-quakecon-2014-reboot/). Classic elements of the original such as the monsters and the quick and aggressive gameplay are brought back, and new characters and features give the experience a fresh take. It boasts a [Very Positive user review standing on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/#app_reviews_hash), both recently and overall.

## Final Thoughts
There are plenty of games I enjoy, but few that make me laugh with pure glee as frequently as this game. Even moving the character through the levels is delightfully fluid and effortless, and the game runs like a dream. Learning to play is a breeze, which makes it faster and easier to find one's unique combat style. Each weapon feels balanced and necessary in its own way for various scenarios. I appreciate the way the user interface has been designed to stay out of the player's way, because it emphasizes a focus on action rather than a menu. The gradually unfolding story and mysterious supporting characters add substance to the action, and the longer one plays, the more they feel they're part of a bigger picture.

The only reason I didn't give this my highest rating possible was the formatting of the subtitles. Spoken dialog is presented as ever-growing blocks of text at the bottom of the screen, rather than brief and easier-to-read segments presented one-by-one. Stopping to read the subtitles feels like screeching to a sudden halt, which is a shame in such a fast-paced experience with so much to see.

With that said, I would say DOOM easily makes my top ten list of all-time favorite video games. Everything from the soundtrack to the visual design has been lovingly crafted to immerse the player and make them feel like the powerful savior needed to blast Hell back to the pit where it belongs. It reminds me why I fell in love with video games in the first place. The graphic violence isn't for everyone, but if you're like me and relish a little ripping and tearing, you'll have a Hell of a good time.
