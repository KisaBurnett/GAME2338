### Rating
4.9 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
The 2016 entry in the gruesomely fun DOOM series marks a return to fast-paced shooter action after the slower, more suspenseful experience in DOOM 3.

## Final Thoughts
There are plenty of games I enjoy, but few that make me laugh with pure glee as frequently as this game. Even moving the character through the levels is delightfully fluid and effortless. Each weapon feels balanced and necessary in its own way for various scenarios. I appreciate the way the user interface has been designed to stay out of the player's way, because it emphasizes a focus on action rather than a menu. The gradually unfolding story and mysterious supporting characters add substance to the action, and the longer one plays, the more they feel they're part of a bigger picture. Everything from the soundtrack to the combat to level and enemy design has been lovingly crafted to immerse the player and make them feel like the powerful savior needed to blast Hell back to the pit where it belongs. It reminds me why I fell in love with video games in the first place.

The only reason I didn't give this my highest rating possible was the formatting of the subtitles. Spoken dialog is presented as ever-growing blocks of text at the bottom of the screen, rather than brief and easier-to-read segments presented one-by-one. Stopping to read the subtitles feels like screeching to a sudden halt, which is a shame in such a fast-paced experience.

With that said, I would say DOOM easily makes my top ten list of all-time favorite video games. The graphic violence isn't for everyone, but if you're like me and relish a little ripping and tearing of demons, you'll have a Hell of a good time.
