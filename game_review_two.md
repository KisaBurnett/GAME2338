# Game Review for DOOM (2016)

## Details

### Game Title
DOOM (2016)
<br>[Official Website](https://bethesda.net/en/game/doom-2016)

### Rating
4.9 out of 5 Sparkles.

## Summary
The 2016 entry in the gruesomely fun DOOM series marks a return to fast-paced shooter action after the slower, more suspenseful experience in DOOM 3.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
